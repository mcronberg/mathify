## About the Project

This project serves as an experiment to test the capabilities of AI-assisted development. The entire application was created using:
- GitHub Copilot for code generation
- Visual Studio Code as the IDE
- AI-driven conversation for architecture and design decisions

> **Note**: Even this README file was generated entirely by GitHub Copilot and AI chat interactions, with zero human code writing. The only human input was requesting features and providing feedback. This represents a complete end-to-end AI-assisted development process, including documentation.

> **Development Status**: This project is under active development and needs refactoring to improve code quality and maintainability. Consider it a proof of concept demonstrating AI-assisted development capabilities.

What makes this project unique is that no human developer wrote a single line of code. The human's role was limited to:
- Coming up with the initial concept
- Providing feedback on errors
- Suggesting features and improvements
- Testing the application

The AI system (through GitHub Copilot and chat) demonstrated remarkable capabilities:
- Self-correction when presented with errors
- Learning from mistakes and improving solutions
- Understanding complex requirements
- Maintaining code consistency across files

While the AI did make mistakes during development, it successfully:
- Identified the root causes when presented with errors
- Proposed and implemented fixes
- Refactored code to prevent similar issues
- Maintained code quality throughout iterations

This proves that modern AI tools are capable of handling complete application development with minimal human code intervention.

## Development Process

The entire development process was guided by AI:
1. Initial app structure and design were created through AI prompts
2. Code implementation was assisted by GitHub Copilot
3. Bug fixes and improvements were developed through AI conversation
4. Even this documentation was AI-generated
